<p>The Solar System formed 4.568 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of a region within a large molecular
cloud.[e] This initial cloud was likely several light-years across and probably birthed several stars.[11] As is typical
of molecular clouds, this one consisted mostly of hydrogen, with some helium, and small amounts of heavier elements
fused by previous generations of stars. As the region that would become the Solar System, known as the pre-solar
nebula,[12] collapsed, conservation of angular momentum caused it to rotate faster.</p>
